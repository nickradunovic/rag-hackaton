# LLM Hackathon with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

Welcome to the Language Model (LLM) Hackathon repository! This hackathon is organized as part of a Learning and Development (L&D) session at our workplace. The primary focus is on implementing and utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for Language Models (LLMs). The ultimate goal is to integrate RAG into an existing LLM and showcase its application through a user-friendly interface developed with either Gradio or Streamlit.

### Objective

The primary objective of this hackathon is to enhance our understanding and practical skills in implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Language Models. Participants will be tasked with integrating RAG into a pre-existing LLM and creating a user interface to demonstrate the application.

### Technologies/Frameworks

- **Language Models:** Utilize popular LLMs such as GPT-3, BERT, or others.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implement RAG techniques to improve the LLM's performance.
- **User Interface:** Choose between Gradio or Streamlit for creating an interactive UI.
