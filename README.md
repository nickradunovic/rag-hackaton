# LLM Hackathon with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

Welcome to the Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon repository! This hackathon is organized as part of Bastiaan's LLM session at Future Facts. The primary focus is on implementing and utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). The ultimate goal is to integrate RAG into an existing LLM and showcase its application through a user-friendly interface developed with either Gradio or Streamlit.

### How RAG Works

Traditional language models generate text based on learned patterns and context. RAG takes this a step further by introducing a retrieval mechanism. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Retrieval:** The model performs an initial retrieval step to gather contextually relevant information from a knowledge base or external documents.

2. **Augmentation:** The retrieved information is then seamlessly integrated into the generation process, augmenting the model's understanding and improving the quality of generated content.

3. **Generation:** The model generates text, now equipped with the additional knowledge obtained through retrieval, resulting in more informed and contextually rich output.

## Hackathon Details

### Timeline

- **Start Date:** December 15th, 11:00 AM
- **End Date:** December 15th, 1:00 PM

### Objective

The primary objective of this hackathon is to enhance our understanding and practical skills in implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Large Language Models. Participants will make teams of two and will be tasked with integrating RAG into a provided LLM and creating a user interface to demonstrate the application.

### Technologies/Frameworks

- **Language Models:** Utilize GPT-3.5 as the LLM for this assignment.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implement RAG techniques to improve the LLM's performance on .
- **User Interface:** Choose between Gradio or Streamlit for creating an interactive UI.
